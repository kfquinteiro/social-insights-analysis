# Analysis with Data from Social Media Content

## Overview

I decided to build a package with useful codes for data analysts out there who need ideas to analyze competitors and perform social listening to find insights on what people are saying regarding a subject.

You'll only need to load your own database and adjust the column names while using this code.

## Codes

* If you need a modern visual like a network connecting the words with context, use this code: [Network Plot for Content Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/kfquinteiro/social-insights-analysis/blob/main/Word_count_and_network_plot_for_content_marketing_analysis_with_Instagram_posts.ipynb)
* For word clouds, use this code: [Word Cloud Plot](https://github.com/kfquinteiro/social-insights-analysis/blob/main/Wordcloud%20plot.ipynb)
